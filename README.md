## Challenge Project Overview 

Using Tableau, a data visualization software, I assisted CitiBikes, a bike-sharing company, in presenting a business proposal to launch CitiBikes in other cities. Their business proposal aims to use the successes of New York City's CityBike program to convince other cities to adopt using CitiBikes.  

First, I imported data into Tableau using data from the CitiBike website to build our dashboards. Next, I created and styled worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize the data so that CitiBikes could tell the story of their data during the presentation. After reconfirming the data was accurate, it was finally time to display our visualized data for their business proposal.
