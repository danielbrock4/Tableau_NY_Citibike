# Module 14: NY Citibike with Tableau
## Resources

- **Data Sources:** 
  - From CitiBike Website: [201908-citibike-tripdata.csv](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)
- **Software:** Tableau, Python, Pandas, JupyterLab

## Challenge Project Overview 

Using Tableau, a data visualization software, I assisted CitiBikes, a bike-sharing company, in presenting a business proposal to launch CitiBikes in other cities. Their business proposal aims to use the successes of New York City's CityBike program to convince other cities to adopt using CitiBikes.  

First, I imported data into Tableau using data from the CitiBike website to build our dashboards. Next, I created and styled worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize the data so that CitiBikes could tell the story of their data during the presentation. After reconfirming the data was accurate, it was finally time to display our visualized data for their business proposal. 

## Challange Project Analysis

Story:
  1) During the summer months, Citibike offers rides to more than 2 million customers. Most bike rides range from 2 to 20 minutes.
  2) Citibike locations now cover NYC and are integrated into the city as a transportations alternative.  
  3) During the weekdays, customers use bikes to travel to and from work, which is indicated by the peak hours. On the weekends, bikes usage increases during the afternoons, telling us our bikes are now part of users' weekend activities.
  4) Males tend to be the largest Citibike users any day of the week.
  5) However, this may be a good strategy to target our new bike locations around popular male attractions or gathering spots.
